# Level Building Sidekick 2025

LBS is an extension designed for [Unity Engine](https://unity.com), which facilitates developers in creating environments for their video games, thereby contributing to increased productivity. This extension features **artificial intelligence assistants** in various areas, which suggest modifications based on the fundamental characteristics developed by the user. These suggestions enable developers to explore new possibilities without manually creating these variations, fostering greater creative freedom.

## Introduction

Level Building Sidekick (LBS) is a tool that allows software developers to define the architecture, constraints, graphical elements, and decorative details that will be used in the construction of a level for video games and other areas. This process enables increased team productivity and the quality and diversity of content they can offer to their users. The tool allows artists to upload any assets they have created for their projects, enabling them to compose custom asset sets for different genres, sections, or styles. LBS is a mixed-initiative content generation tool focused on creating content such as levels, population, and missions.

The intelligent assistants automatically suggest options or variations of this content that share common characteristics with what was initially established by developers. Thus, when creating a level proposal, it is easy to have a variety of configuration alternatives thanks to the different artistic resources that the designer can upload and the suggestions given by the intelligent assistants.

Level Building Sidekick runs as an extension of the Unity game engine. This tool adds a series of new customizable windows within the development environment, following the engine's philosophy of working all related disciplines within it and not needing to use multiple tools at once. It allows modifications to be serialized, thus enabling them to be shared with other developers who can then continue modifying them.

The architecture of this tool is oriented towards element composition, allowing LBS to continue expanding both by the development team and its users. Additionally, this approach makes LBS a great research platform, as it allows new AI techniques to be added to the same tool without having to start from scratch, cutting down development times and allowing researchers to focus on relevant areas of their research.
