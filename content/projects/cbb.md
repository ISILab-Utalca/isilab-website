**Character Brain Booster** will allow video game developers and designers to define and configure features of enemies and participants that interact with the leading actor during the video game design and testing phases as a debugging tool.

We are starting the collaborative development of an **Enemy Personality Configuration tool** for video game designers and developers to assist them in defining and configuring the behavior of enemies and participants who interact with the leading actor (the player) in a video game. The tool, codenamed Character Brain Booster (CBB), will allow video game developers and designers to define and configure features of enemies and participants that interact with the leading actor during the video game design and testing phases as a debugging tool. Although existing video game engines offer tools for that purpose, they only work in the design stage; video game developers cannot update enemy features in online testing. 


CBB will permit configuring features of video game enemies during debugging to look for a high userâ€™s game-playing experience and satisfaction. In addition, CBB will offer a utility system to suggest enemy behavior options considering the current and eventual future state regarding behavior options.
