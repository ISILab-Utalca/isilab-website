LBS is a mixed-initiative content generation tool focused on creating content such as levels, population and quests.

Level Building Sidekick (LBS) allows interactive software developers to define the architecture, constraints, graphical elements and decorative details to be used in the construction of a proposed game level. This process allows an increase of the quality and diversity of content they can offer their players. The tool allows artists to upload any type of art they create for their game, allowing them to compose custom art sets for different genres, sections or styles. 

### Assistant

The intelligent Assistant automatically suggest options or variations of this content that share common characteristics with what was initially established by the developers. Thus, when creating a level proposal, it is easy to have a variety of alternative configurations thanks to the different artistic resources that can be loaded by the designer and the suggestions given by the intelligent assistants.

### Unity integration

Level Building Sidekick runs as an extension of the Unity game engine. This tool adds a series of new customizable windows within the development environment, following the philosophy of the engine to work all disciplines related to it within the same and not having the need to use multiple tools at once. It allows to save the modifications in a serialized way, so that they can be shared with other developers and they can continue modifying.




The architecture of this tool has an element composition orientation, allowing LBS to continue to be extended by both the development team and its users. In addition, this approach makes LBS a great research platform, as it allows new AI techniques to be added on top of the same tool without having to start from scratch, cutting development times and allowing the researcher to focus on the relevant areas of their research.


LBS has four modules: interior space design, exterior space design, game element layout and mission design.
