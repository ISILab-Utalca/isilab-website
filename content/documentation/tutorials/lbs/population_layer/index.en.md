**Module 2 - Population:** describes how the population works. In the maps created, whether exterior or interior, you can place **assets**, **entities** and **decorative elements** such as enemies, players, furniture, weapons, rewards, among others. There is also an assistant called `Map-Elites`, which is an AI that orders and generates different varieties of position of the elements on the map.
