## Installation
LBS, an extension for Unity Engine, follows a standard installation process similar to other Unity extensions. Below are the necessary steps for installation:

System Requirements: This extension is developed to be compatible with **Unity 6 versions 6000.40.3f1** or higher. To start the installation, it is required to download some packages like `newtonsoft.JSON`. The engine will recognize the package and open a window that will facilitate its import.

### Release

> Version 6000.40.3f1

[Download! and repository site!](https://github.com/ISILab-Utalca/LevelBuildingSidekick/releases/tag/release-0.2.3-hotfix)

## Usage
To start working, select the ISILab window in **Window>ISILab>LevelBuildingSidekick**, this will open the main window of the tool with which you can start working. Next, we will provide a series of general descriptions that you can follow to manage the tool:

In the main window, you will find a large working area visualized with a tiling of squares, in this area you can place, move, and remove elements to shape your levels. To the right of this, you will find an internal inspector that will allow you to work with the specific values of the elements to be modified, their base behaviors, and the assistants that will help you work with this tool.


In addition to this, we can find in the vertical bar between these two aforementioned elements 3 general buttons, which will allow showing and hiding 3 main panels to organize the work. The first corresponds to a panel to organize the content of the level by layers, the second corresponds to a panel to work by layers the quests that are created on these levels, and the third corresponds to the panel that will allow us to pass these levels to structures directly usable in unity.

### Layers
