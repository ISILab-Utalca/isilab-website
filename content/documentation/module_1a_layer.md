## Module 1A - Interior Layer

The schematic is a `Tilemap` representing the level created in this module. The rooms can be modified by painting or removing the boxes. You can create zones to determine the number and positions of the rooms, by changing the data of these zones you can determine their size, and by generating connections you indicate which rooms are connected by doors.
